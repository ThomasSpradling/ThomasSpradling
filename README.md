I recently graduated University of California, San Diego and am looking for work. Some things about me:
- I triple majored in Math, Physics, and Chemistry while at university.
- I study computer science coursework for fun.

Currently I'm doing mathematics research under the Kedlaya group at UCSD. More information about that will be given Soon™.
